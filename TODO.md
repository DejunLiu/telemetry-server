- [P1] Error handling in pipe-based compressor
- [P2] nginx: Check into load-balancing
- [P2] nginx: Accept gzip-encoded submissions
- [P2] Figure out idle-daily de-duplication
- [P2] Supply the correct Histograms.json spec for each record to the Mapper
- [P2] MapReduce: make sure to create all the mapper_x_y files (since we might
       end up with a file whose keys don't hash to all possible reducer
       buckets).
- [P2] MapReduce: delete downloaded data files after they have been processed.
- [P2] Improve speed of the conversion process
- [P2] Define data access policy
  -  read access?
  -  retention period
  -  investigate [S3's Lifecycle policy][7] (send to glacier, eventually
     expire)
- [P3] Have the "archive" job write bad input records to the invalid_data dir
- [P3] Check if the compressor (and exporter) cron job is already running, and
       if so don't start another instance.
- [P3] Stream data from S3 for MapReduce instead of downloading first
- [P3] Investigate using Amazon ElasticMapReduce for MR jobs (instead of
       fetching and running locally)
- [P3] Add timeout/retry around fetching Histograms.json from hg.mozilla.org
- [P3] Add many tests
- [P3] Add runtime performance metrics using [scales][1] and on-demand perf
       tests using [cProfile][3]
- [P3] Add proper [logging][2]
- [P3] Ensure things are in order to accept Addon Histograms, such as
       from [pdf.js][5]
- [P4] Change the RevisionCache to fetch the entire history of Histograms.json
       and then convert incoming revisions to times to find the right version
- [P4] Preopen the mapper input files in the parent process, pass fd's to child
       process to avoid race condition with the compressor.
